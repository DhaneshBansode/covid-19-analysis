# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Project Overview
Comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data including case trends, death rates, vaccination progress, and correlation analysis between key metrics across multiple countries.

## Business Problem
Understanding the impact of COVID-19 across different countries and analyzing the relationship between vaccination rates and death rates to inform public health strategies.

## Solution
- Analyzed COVID-19 data for 8 countries
- Compared death rates and vaccination progress
- Performed correlation analysis between key metrics
- Created normalized metrics for fair comparison (cases per million)
- Generated comprehensive visualizations

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data analysis and visualization
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization and chart creation
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation analysis, normalized metrics

## Key Features
- Country-wise COVID-19 data analysis
- Death rate and vaccination rate comparison
- Correlation analysis between variables
- Cases per million population normalization
- Interactive visualizations and heatmaps

## Key Findings
- Strong negative correlation between vaccination rates and death rates
- Significant variation in vaccination progress between countries
- Population-normalized metrics provide better comparisons
- Countries with higher vaccination rates showed better outcomes

## Installation & Usage
